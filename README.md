# Randel-Tales-Lust-Update
“Lost your past. Train as a warrior. Choose your path - monster-slayer, lover or legend.”
Enter the realm of Merdian — a vast magical land of elves, dwarves, goblins and untold mysteries under the shadow of an ancient war. In Randel Tales, you assume the role of a young man with no memory of his past, taken in by a merchant and brought to the small town of Randel. From there you embark on your journey as a soldier-trainee in the Adventurers’ Guild, navigating dangerous monster hunts, exploration, and complex relationships with a cast of alluring characters. 


Your choices matter: train sword, bow, or sorcery; accept quests from the guild; decide who to trust, romance, or betray; and uncover many intertwined storylines filled with adult content and moral ambiguity. 


Why Play It?

Rich fantasy setting: A medieval-style world torn between war, monsters and political intrigue.

Deep character routes: Multiple female characters each with their own storyline, quests and endings. 

Quest & progression system: Complete monster hunts, train your skills, join the guild — progression feels meaningful. 


Adult storytelling: Mature themes, romance and choices that lead to radically different outcomes.

Cross-platform accessibility: Available on PC and mobile platforms in English.
